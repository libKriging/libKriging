# Commit Message Format
(inspired from git commit message from angular style and git-commit-message-convention repository)

```
[<type>[(<scope>)]: ]<subject>[ (#task)]
<empty ling>
<body>
<empty ling>
<footer>
```

## Types

| Type          | Description |
|:-------------:|-------------|
| `feature`     | for new feature implementing commit |
| `fix`         | for bug fix commit |
| `security`    | for security issue fix commit |
| `performance` | for performance issue fix commit |
| `improvement` | for backwards-compatible enhancement commit |
| `breaking`    | for backwards-incompatible enhancement commit |
| `deprecated`  | for deprecated feature commit |
| `i18n`        | for i18n (internationalization) commit |
| `refactor`    | for refactoring commit |
| `style`       | for coding style commit |
| `docs`        | for documentation commit |
| `example`     | for example code commit |
| `test`        | for testing commit |
| `dependency`  | for dependencies upgrading or downgrading commit |
| `config`      | for configuration commit |
| `build`       | for packaging or bundling commit |
| `ci`          | for continuous integration commit |
| `release`     | for publishing commit |
| `update`      | for update commit |
| `revert`      | for revert commit |
| `wip`         | for work in progress commit |

## Scope
The scope could be anything specifying place or category of the commit change.
For example tests, core, R, python, octave, etc...

## Subject
The subject contains succinct description of the change:

* use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
* don't capitalize first letter
* no dot (.) at the end

To skip Travis CI build, the HEAD commit message on push must contain `[skip ci]`.

## Message Body
Just as in the **Subject**, use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes". 
The body should include the motivation for the change and contrast this with previous behavior.

## Message Footer
The Message Footer should contain any information about **Notes** and also Message Footer 
should be **recommended** [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/features#issues) ID Reference, 
Ex. `Issue #27`, `Fixes #1`, `Closes #2`, `Resolves #3`.

**Notes** should start with the word `NOTE:` with a space or two newlines. 
The rest of the commit message is then used for this.


## Revert
If the commit reverts a previous commit, it should begin with **revert:**, 
followed by the header of the reverted commit. In the body it should say: 
`This reverts commit <hash>.`, where <hash> is the SHA of the commit being reverted.

## Examples

new feature:
```
feature(python): add 'custom expression' option
```

bug fix:
```
fix(R): correct memory corrumption while passing R objects

Closes #28
```

improve performance:
```
performance(core): improve thread management

Default OpenMP thread dispatch is now tuned to be compatible with outer threads from R 
```

revert:
```
revert: feature(python): add 'custom expression' option

This reverts commit 667ecc1654a317a13331b17617d973392f415f02.
```

skip ci:
```
doc: fix minor mispelling [skip ci]

CI build is a waste of time for a so tiny mispelling fix. 
```

# Pull request procedure

When you submit a pull request, be sure that 
* your code is well formatted (use `cmake --build . --target clang-format` for force format using clang-format)
  
  it will be check by travis-ci
  
* you have removed useless debug outputs

* you added tests for any new features

* you have checked clang-tidy warnings (on your workstation or using travis-ci output)
  
  You can disable irrelevant warnings using `NOLINT` or `NOLINTNEXTLINE` special comments (see https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/#suppressing-undesired-diagnostics)
  
* Your commit history is clean

  all your commits are 
  * self-consistent
  * with an explicit and descriptive message log
  
## Perfect Pull Request procedure

If your PR passed without continuous integration error, you PR should be merged after being approved. 
Meanwhile you can work on your branch (or a derived branch). After effective merge into main libKriging repository, you can merge it with your current branch to be up-to-date.

To do so:
```
# from your local repository
git remote add --fetch libKriging https://github.com/MASCOTNUM/libKriging.git || git fetch libKriging # add main remote repository or fetch it
git merge --ff libKriging/master # update with merged master branch
git push # update your fork with it
```

## Non-perfect Pull Request procedure

It occurs if any work is required by maintainer before an effective merge. 

In that case, your commits could be changed (for binary removal, commit squash, fixing issues...). 
This is usually done in a dedicated branch named `PR-XX`. After the effective merge of this branch `PR-XX`, you have to rebase your work on it.

To rebase your work on it, you can:

* If you have no new change
```
git remote add --fetch libKriging https://github.com/MASCOTNUM/libKriging.git || git fetch libKriging # add main remote repository or fetch it
git reset --hard libKriging/master # reset to main master version
git push # update your fork with it
```

* If you have new changes

```
WORKING_BRANCH=master # defines which you want to rebase with main master version
git checkout $WORKING_BRANCH
git tag -f before-rebase # this tag references your version before rebase (thus, nothing can be lost)
git remote add libKriging https://github.com/MASCOTNUM/libKriging.git || git fetch libKriging # add main remote repository or fetch it
NEW_COMMIT_BASE=      # set the id of the first new commit you want to rebase onto main master
git rebase --onto libKriging/master $NEW_COMMIT_BASE # replay your commits on main master
# if conflict occurs, solve them (you can use `git mergetool` to do it)
git rebase --continue # continue rebase (after conflict resolution) 
git push -f # update your fork with it (you have to force with -f since you rewrite history)
```
