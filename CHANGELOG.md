# Changelog

All notable changes to libKriging are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project aims to follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

This file was introduced during the 1.x cycle. For the detailed notes of each
past release, see the corresponding entry on the
[GitHub releases page](https://github.com/libKriging/libKriging/releases).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Python: scikit-learn compatible estimators for all four Kriging classes —
  `KrigingRegressor`, `WarpKrigingRegressor`, `MLPKrigingRegressor`,
  `NestedKrigingRegressor` in `pylibkriging.sklearn`, implementing the
  scikit-learn estimator API (`fit`/`predict`, `get_params`/`set_params`,
  `clone`) so they drop into `Pipeline` and `GridSearchCV` (#338).
- Cross-package comparison benchmark (`bench/comparison/`): libKriging vs.
  scikit-learn/GPy/SMT/OpenTURNS (Python) and DiceKriging/RobustGaSP (R) on
  shared randomized LHS designs (Branin, Hartmann-3/6, Borehole), reporting
  fit/predict time, RMSE, Q², NLPD; runs on a manual/monthly CI workflow (#335).
- `Kriging::subsetOfData`: k-means (or random) pre-fit row-subsetting for
  large designs. Available in the core C++ API and all four bindings
  (Python/R/Julia/Octave-MATLAB); see `docs/math/SubsetOfData.md` and
  `Scalability.md` (#358).
- `nystrom_rank()` accessor exposed in the Julia, Octave/MATLAB and R
  bindings (Python already had it); worked notebooks
  `docs/math/llnystrom_vs_cholesky.ipynb` / `llvecchia_vs_cholesky.ipynb`
  comparing `LLNystrom`/`LLVecchia` against exact Cholesky (#358).

### Changed
- Python: dropped the `numpy<2` pin — `pylibkriging` now supports NumPy 2.x.
  Required bumping the vendored `pybind11` (2.10.1 → 2.13.6) and `carma`
  submodules, since both hardcode offsets into NumPy's C-API function table
  and predated the NumPy 2.0 ABI changes; also fixed a bug in carma's own
  NumPy-2.0 fix where `PyArray_CopyInto`'s table offset (which differs
  between NumPy 1.x and 2.x) was hardcoded to the NumPy-2-only value instead
  of being picked at runtime (#339, libKriging/carma#1).

### Fixed
- `WarpKriging` `knots(k)` warping (Xiong et al. 2007) now maps inputs from
  their training range onto its reference domain `[0, 1]` internally, like
  `DiceKriging`'s `knots` argument. Previously inputs on any other scale were
  all clamped to the `[0, 1]` boundary, collapsing the design: the warp
  diverged (`|params|` to ~15, `theta` to its bound) instead of settling on
  the identity, and the fit was tens of nats / ~40x RMSE worse than a plain
  stationary GP. Models fit on `[0, 1]` inputs are bit-for-bit unchanged
  (the default range is the identity map). New regression test
  `test_knots_input_scale_invariance` in `WarpKrigingTest`.
- `optim="none"` silently fell through to a plain exact factorization for
  a light Vecchia fit (`set_vecchia_exact_commit(false)`), ignoring the
  requested `LLVecchia(m)` objective entirely instead of committing a
  genuine light fit at the given theta (the same class of bug already
  fixed for `LLNystrom` in #353) (#358).
- R: `.match_kriging_objective`'s internal validator no longer hijacks
  `Kriging`'s roxygen `@export` documentation (#329).
- Python: `loading_test`'s version check no longer hardcodes the expected
  version, reading it from `cmake/version.cmake` instead so it doesn't need
  updating on every release (#328).
- CI: Windows jobs retry the `choco install` step to absorb transient
  community-feed 504s (#326); `rlibkriging`'s `tools/gitmodules-shas` is kept
  in sync with submodule bumps, staged in the right order (#330, #331).

### Documentation
- Added a coding-agent skill covering libKriging usage patterns (#336) and a
  "Known pitfalls" section to `AGENTS.md` (#333).

### CI/Release process
- Automated `jlibkriging` registration on Julia's General registry (#332).
- GitHub release notes are now filled in from this changelog (#334).

## [1.1.0] - 2026-07-08

### Added
- `NestedKriging`: divide-and-conquer Gaussian process for large designs —
  partition of `(X, y)` into groups with one Kriging submodel each, unified
  hyperparameters, and aggregated predictions (PoE / gPoE / BCM / rBCM and the
  optimal nested-kriging `NK` aggregation), with Python/R/Octave/Matlab/Julia
  bindings (#317).
- Vecchia approximated log-likelihood objective `VLL(m)`, with local prediction
  and a factorization-free "light" mode (#318).

### Fixed
- Fork-after-threads deadlock in forked child processes (#319).
- Windows CI on the `windows-2025-vs2026` runner image: CMake pinned to the
  version providing the "Visual Studio 18 2026" generator, and Octave/conda
  setup (#320).
- Thread Sanitizer job: removed false-positive data races caused by GCC's
  uninstrumented OpenMP runtime (libgomp) (#320).
- Constructor argument consistency across bindings: R `Kriging` now accepts
  `objective="VLL(m)"` and the `"quadratic"` trend, with `noise` as the last
  argument (aligned with Python/WarpKriging); Julia `Kriging`/`NestedKriging`
  accept a `parameters` dict like the other classes (#323).

### Documentation
- Documentation, licensing and metadata review: fixed stale dependency and
  architecture docs, added scientific and input-warping references, added
  `CITATION.cff`, `NOTICE` and this changelog, and README features/license/
  citation sections (#321).
